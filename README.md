# industry_standards

How to contribute to a project following the industry standard:
Open source way:

1. Open an issue [for a feature, bug, docs, style refactor ] same as the commit messages to keep things simple.

  - issues must be created following a template, and appropriate tags must be given.

2. Fork the project

3. Create a branch for that issue on your fork
  - with presumably similar name on the branch as the issue  

5. Commit and push as many times to your branch as needed to satisfy that issue.
  - follow the semantic commit messages

6. Do a Pull Request (PR) of that branch on that issue.
  - follow the pr protocol

8. If the issue is still not satisfied, continue to commit and push to that issue.
